# üß† LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my personal LeetCode repository!  
This is where I document my journey through solving coding problems to improve my algorithmic thinking and technical interview skills.

## üìö About This Repository

This repo contains solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems in languages I use regularly ‚Äî mainly **Java**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

Each solution is structured, well-commented, and tested for clarity and reusability. I use this repository to:

- Keep track of my learning progress
- Revisit patterns and techniques
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Share insights and approaches with others

## üß© Problem Categories

Common topics include:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hash Tables  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- and more...

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

Each folder contains:
- Problem description (link to LeetCode)
- My solution code
- Optional explanation or approach in comments

## üöÄ Let‚Äôs Connect

Feel free to fork, star ‚≠ê, or follow!  
If you have suggestions or spot improvements ‚Äî open an issue or pull request.
